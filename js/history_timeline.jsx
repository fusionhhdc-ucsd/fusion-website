            In 2018, FUSION XVIII will mark FUSION’s eighteenth iteration with
            an established history. As an organization, FUSION began in 1999
            alongside of MASA and kunFUSION. By 2000, MASA and 220, its
            competitive dance team, held FUSION I at PC West Ballroom, where
            security guards were forced to stop letting people in due to
            overcapacity. As the show grew older, it grew larger and moved to
            RIMAC Arena. During its peak years around 2008, coinciding with the
            peak years of America’s Best Dance Crew and public interest in the
            hip hop dance community as a whole, FUSION attracted 3000 audience
            members and performers, one of the largest attendance number at any
            hip hop dance event anywhere.

            Unfortunately, in 2012, FUSION XIII was canceled to the heartbreak
            of many older MASA members and dancers in the hip hop community as
            a whole due to venue problems. Additionally, MASA and 220 mutually
            agreed to split ways as well because 220 desired to pursue their
            competitive dreams with all of their energy. The following year,
            FUSION XIII was brought back by MASA alone to the delight of the
            dance community, while 220 has become respected as a rising force
            with multiple first and second place finishes at other hip hop
            dance competitions.

            As an organization, FUSION began in 1999 alongside of MASA and
            kunFUSION. Originally started as a collaboration between MASA and
            220, its competitive dance team, FUSION I was held at PC West
            Ballroom, UCSD. Over time, the show grew and to be able to provide
            for a larger audience attraction. FUSION moved to RIMAC Arena,
              UCSD. During its peak years around 2008, coinciding with the
            peak years of America’s Best Dance Crew and public interest in the
            hip hop dance community as a whole, FUSION attracted 3000 audience
            members and performers, one of the largest attendance number at any
            hip hop dance event anywhere. As the competition became more
            noticed, FUSION expanded and held events in downtown San Diego. For
            the last three years, FUSION has been held in Golden Hall, where we
            have developed a strong relationship with the organization and
            shared many wonderful memories. FUSION XIX will mark FUSION’s
            twentieth iteration with this established history.
